# GitHub Team-to-Repository Mapping Script

## Overview

The `map_teams_to_repos.ps1` PowerShell script automates the process of granting GitHub teams access to repositories based on CSV file mappings. The script intelligently analyzes team member roles and grants appropriate permission levels to ensure teams have the access they need.

## Features

- **Role-Based Permissions**: Analyzes CSV roles to determine appropriate team permissions
- **Custom Repository Roles**: Full support for GitHub custom repository roles alongside standard roles
- **Permission Hierarchy**: Grants highest permission level among team members
- **Team Validation**: Verifies teams exist before granting repository access
- **Repository Validation**: Confirms repositories exist in the organization
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Processes unique repository-team pairs only
- **Dry Run Support**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Environment File Support**: Load configuration from `.env` files

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- **PowerShell 7+** (Cross-platform)
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with appropriate permissions

### GitHub Token Permissions
Your GitHub token needs the following permissions:
- `repo` (Full repository access)
- `admin:org` (Organization administration)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the script directory or set these environment variables:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_personal_access_token_here
GITHUB_ORG=your-github-organization-name
# GHE_URL=https://your-github-enterprise-url.com  # Only for GitHub Enterprise
```

## CSV File Format

The script reads the same CSV format as `provision_users.ps1`:

| Column | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `Repo` | Repository name | Used to identify target repository |
| `User` | GitHub username | Used to group by team |
| `Role` | User role (Admin, Write, Read, or custom role name) | Analyzed to determine team permissions |
| `Team` | Team name | Target team for repository access |

### Processing Logic

1. **Team Filtering**: Only processes entries where `Team` column is not empty
2. **Role Analysis**: Collects all roles for each repository-team combination
3. **Permission Calculation**: Determines highest permission level needed for the team
4. **Access Grant**: Grants team access to repository with calculated permission

## Permission Hierarchy

### Standard Roles Hierarchy
The script uses the following permission hierarchy for standard roles (highest to lowest):

| Priority | Role | GitHub Permission | Description |
|----------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 (Highest) | `Admin` | `admin` | Full administrative access |
| 2 | `Maintain` | `maintain` | Maintain access (manage settings) |
| 3 | `Write` | `push` | Read and write access |
| 4 | `Triage` | `triage` | Triage access (manage issues/PRs) |
| 5 (Lowest) | `Read` | `pull` | Read-only access |

### Custom Repository Roles

**Custom Role Handling:**
- Custom roles are automatically detected from your GitHub organization
- When team members have custom roles, those take priority over standard roles
- If multiple custom roles exist for a team, the first one found is used
- Custom roles are applied using GitHub's `role_name` API parameter

**Mixed Role Scenarios:**
- **Team with only custom roles**: Uses the first custom role found
- **Team with only standard roles**: Uses standard hierarchy (Admin > Maintain > Write > Triage > Read)
- **Team with mixed roles**: Custom roles take priority; standard roles are used as fallback

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: Team has mixed roles
```csv
Repo,User,Role,Team
my-app,dev1,Read,frontend-team
my-app,dev2,Write,frontend-team
```
**Result**: `frontend-team` gets `push` permission (highest among Read/Write)

**Scenario 2**: Team has admin member
```csv
Repo,User,Role,Team
my-api,lead1,Admin,backend-team
my-api,dev3,Write,backend-team
```
**Result**: `backend-team` gets `admin` permission (highest among Admin/Write)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Map teams to repositories based on CSV roles
./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/User_Provisioning.csv'
```

### Dry Run (Recommended First)

```powershell
# Preview what permissions would be granted
./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/User_Provisioning.csv' -DryRun
```

### Running on macOS

```bash
# From Terminal using pwsh
pwsh -File ./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/User_Provisioning.csv'

# Or launch PowerShell first
pwsh
./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/User_Provisioning.csv'
```

## Sample CSV and Expected Results

### Standard Roles Input CSV
```csv
Repo,User,Role,Team
hello-world,alice,Read,good-team
hello-world,bob,Read,good-team
hello-world,carol,Write,nice-team
hello-world,dave,Write,nice-team
hello-world,admin,Admin,
```

**Expected Processing:**
- `good-team`: Gets `pull` permission (all members have Read roles)
- `nice-team`: Gets `push` permission (all members have Write roles)
- `admin` user: Ignored (no team specified, handled by `provision_users.ps1`)

### Custom Roles Input CSV
```csv
Repo,User,Role,Team
my-api,security-lead,Security Reviewer,security-team
my-api,scanner,Code Scanner,security-team
my-api,deployer,Deploy Manager,deploy-team
my-api,dev1,Write,deploy-team
my-api,admin,Admin,
```

**Expected Processing:**
- `security-team`: Gets `Security Reviewer` permission (custom role takes priority)
- `deploy-team`: Gets `Deploy Manager` permission (custom role over standard Write)
- `admin` user: Ignored (no team specified)

### Mixed Roles Input CSV
```csv
Repo,User,Role,Team
my-app,lead,Admin,mixed-team
my-app,security,Security Reviewer,mixed-team
my-app,dev,Write,mixed-team
```

**Expected Processing:**
- `mixed-team`: Gets `Security Reviewer` permission (custom role prioritized over Admin/Write)

## Script Output

The script provides detailed output showing role analysis and custom role detection:

```
Validating GitHub organization 'my-org'...
Organization 'my-org' found.
Found 6 entries in CSV file.
Found 3 unique repository-team mappings to process.
Loading custom repository roles for organization 'my-org'...
Found 2 custom repository role(s): Security Reviewer, Deploy Manager

Processing: Repository 'my-api' -> Team 'security-team' (slug: security-team) with 'Security Reviewer' permission (Roles: Security Reviewer, Code Scanner)
Granting team 'security-team' 'Security Reviewer' access to repository 'my-api'...
Successfully granted team 'security-team' 'Security Reviewer' access to repository 'my-api'

Processing: Repository 'my-api' -> Team 'deploy-team' (slug: deploy-team) with 'Deploy Manager' permission (Roles: Deploy Manager, Write)
Granting team 'deploy-team' 'Deploy Manager' access to repository 'my-api'...
Successfully granted team 'deploy-team' 'Deploy Manager' access to repository 'my-api'

--- Team-to-Repository Mapping Summary ---
Successful repository access grants: 2
Failed repository access grants: 0
Permissions determined dynamically based on team member roles
```

## Error Handling

The script handles various error scenarios:

- **Repository Not Found**: Validates repository exists before granting access
- **Team Not Found**: Checks team exists and suggests running `provision_users.ps1` first
- **API Errors**: Provides detailed error messages for GitHub API failures
- **Invalid Data**: Skips entries with missing repository or team information

## Integration Workflow

This script is designed to work with `provision_users.ps1` in a two-step workflow:

### Step 1: User and Team Provisioning
```powershell
./provision_users.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/User_Provisioning.csv'
```
- Creates teams if they don't exist
- Adds users to teams
- Grants direct repository access where specified

### Step 2: Team Repository Access
```powershell
./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/User_Provisioning.csv'
```
- Analyzes team member roles
- Grants teams appropriate repository permissions
- Ignores entries without team assignments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Team not found"**
   - Run `provision_users.ps1` first to create teams and add members
   - Verify team names match exactly between scripts

2. **"Repository not found"**
   - Check repository name spelling
   - Ensure repository exists in the specified organization
   - Verify token has access to the repository

3. **"No mappings to process"**
   - Ensure CSV has entries with both `Repo` and `Team` columns filled
   - Check CSV format and column headers

### Debugging Tips

**Enable verbose output:**
```powershell
./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath './users/test.csv' -Verbose
```

**Check team slug conversion:**
- Team names are converted to slugs (lowercase, dots/spaces â†’ hyphens)
- Example: "My Team.Name" becomes "my-team-name"

**Validate CSV structure:**
```powershell
Import-Csv './users/test.csv' | Format-Table
```

## Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: Store tokens securely, never commit to version control
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Teams get minimum permissions needed
- **Audit Trail**: Script provides detailed logs for compliance
- **Role Validation**: Unknown roles default to `pull` permission with warnings

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Permission Override
If you need all teams to have a specific permission regardless of member roles, modify the CSV to have consistent roles for all team members.

### Batch Processing
Process multiple CSV files:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\users\*.csv" | ForEach-Object {
    ./map_teams_to_repos.ps1 -CsvFilePath $_.FullName -DryRun
}
```

### Role Distribution Analysis
Analyze role distribution before processing:
```powershell
$data = Import-Csv './users/User_Provisioning.csv'
$data | Where-Object { $_.Team } | Group-Object Team, Role | Format-Table Count, Name
```
